                <h4>What I like</h4>
                <p>
                    I like many of the design choices of the ones that make their website simple, sleek and easy to read.
                </p>
                <h4>What I dislike</h4>
                <p>
                    A lot of portfolio websites have a lot of effort put into them to make them a fun and engaging experience to go through.
                    Those interactive websites are cool, but I think they lack the professionalism and simplicity that would aid in actually getting hired, wich is the main goal of the website.
                </p>
                <h4>How mine will be better</h4>
                <p>
                    For my website I will take what I think is the best approach, to make it easy for the recruiter to see your value and how to reach you. 
                    Another important thing to keep in mind is quality over quantity.
                    You want them to see you at your best, so make sure they see your best work first.
