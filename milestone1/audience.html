                    The primary audience is located in St. George and the surrounding area because that is the only 
                    place I am interested in getting employed unless the job was 100% remote.
                </p>
                <h4>Age</h4>
                <p>
                    The age range would probably be around 35-45 based on the average age of a recruiter.
                </p>
                <h4>Gender</h4>
                <p>
                    The gender ratio would most likely be 60:40 with men being slightly more likely to visit based on the percent of men and women in the tech industry.
                </p>
